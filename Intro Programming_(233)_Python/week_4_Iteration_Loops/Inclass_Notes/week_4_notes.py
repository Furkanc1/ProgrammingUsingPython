# condition controlled loop: (while loop)
# While true:
# Do this
# test something
# stop program
# BREAK can be used to stop a while loop (if "this" is true, Stop the program or "break")

# FOR-LOOP:
john = "john"
for variableHere in john:
    print(variableHere)
# output:
# j
# o
# h
# n

# Example of IMPORTING FUNCTION / METHOD (similar to math.random() )
# import random

# count = 0
# threshold = 10
# while count < threshold:
#     print(random.random())
#     count += 1
