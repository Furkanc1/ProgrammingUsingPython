Welcome to the Mideterm for INFO-233

Directions: -  Credit for the problem will not be given without proper comments. All code must contain comments to explain your logic.
    1. Read through all of the comments in this file and follow the directions exactly. There are extra credit options in problems 2,3 & 4. Choose any 3 problems to complete for the exam
    2. Your code's output must match the expected output from each problem.
    3. Original work only. Your work must be your own. 
    4. When completed, save the file as info-233-midterm_yourlastname and uipload it the assignment in Canvas
    5. Good luck and relax. Use all of the resources you have.

### Problem 3
## This problem covers the concepts of:
##      
##      1.Function definition
##      2.Passing and returning variables to and from functions
##      3.Iteration 
##      5.Eroor handling - Breaking out of a program
##      6.formatting output using print

### Create code which:

##  1. contains a function called toCelcius()
##      A. accepts a single variable into the function
##      B. converts the variable to degrees Celcius
##      C. returns the variable to the main program

##  2. contains a function called toFarenheit()
##      A. accepts a single variable into the function
##      B. converts the variable to degrees Farenheit
##      C. returns the variable to the main program


##  3. The main program 
##      A. Asks a user if they want to convert to Farenheit to Celcius select 1, select 2 for Celcius to Farenheit or select 3 to quit
##      B.  Check to make sure the user's reponse is either 1 , 2 or 3, anything else is an invalid choice      
##      B. Depending on the users input of which conversion or quit the program:
##          1. Asks for input of temperature - decimal number
##          2. call the appropriate function and return the answer to the main program.. Print statements are not allowed in the functions.        
##      C. In the main prgram, print out the result of the conversion in an user-friendly answer
##  

## The Formulas
##  1. Celsius to Fahrenheit Formula
#   ùêπ = (ùê∂ ‚àó 9/5) + 32

##  2. Farenheit to Celcius Formula
#   C=(F - 32) / (9/5)
